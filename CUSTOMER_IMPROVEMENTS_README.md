# SmartPick Customer Homepage Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the enhancements made to the SmartPick customer homepage to improve user experience, implement a penalty system, and add advanced map features.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Penalty System ✅
- **Database Changes**: Added `penalty_until` (timestamptz) and `penalty_count` (integer) columns to users table
- **Penalty Logic**:
  - 1st missed pickup: 3-hour ban
  - 2nd missed pickup: 12-hour ban
  - 3rd+ missed pickups: 12-hour ban with warning
- **Enforcement**: Users cannot make reservations while under penalty
- **Countdown Timer**: Real-time countdown showing remaining penalty time
- **Auto-Clear**: Penalties automatically lift when time expires
- **Reset on Success**: Penalty count resets to 0 after successful pickup

### 2. Reservation Limit ✅
- **3-Unit Maximum**: Each user can reserve maximum 3 units per offer
- **UI Enforcement**: Quantity selector limited to 1-3 units
- **API Validation**: Backend validates and rejects reservations exceeding 3 units
- **Clear Messaging**: Users see "Max 3 per offer" label

### 3. Enhanced Reservation Modal ✅
**New Component**: `src/components/ReservationModal.tsx`
- **Quantity Selector**: Interactive +/- buttons with input field (1-3 units)
- **Product Image**: Displays offer.images[0] or placeholder
- **Short Description**: Shows offer description
- **Pickup Timer**: Real-time countdown to pickup window end

### 6. Browser Notifications (Optional)
**Status**: Not implemented in this version
**Reason**: Requires additional setup and user permissions

**Planned Features**:
- New offers within 5km
- Reservation confirmed
- Penalty lifted

**Implementation Guide** (for future):
```typescript
// Request permission
Notification.requestPermission();

// Send notification
new Notification('SmartPick', {
  body: 'New offer available near you!',
  icon: '/icon.png'
});
```

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Add Penalty Columns
Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor:
```bash
# File: add-penalty-columns.sql
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS penalty_until TIMESTAMPTZ;

ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS penalty_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_penalty_until ON users(penalty_until);
```

### Step 2: Verify Schema
Check that columns were added:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'users' 
AND column_name IN ('penalty_until', 'penalty_count');
```

## API Changes

### New Functions in `src/lib/api.ts`

1. **checkUserPenalty(userId: string): Promise<PenaltyInfo>**
   - Checks if user is under penalty
   - Returns penalty status, expiry time, and count

2. **applyPenalty(userId: string): Promise<void>**
   - Applies penalty based on count
   - 1st miss = 3h, 2nd+ = 12h

3. **clearPenalty(userId: string): Promise<void>**
   - Clears penalty and resets count
   - Called on successful pickup

### Modified Functions

1. **createReservation()**
   - Added penalty check before creating reservation
   - Enforces 3-unit maximum
   - Throws error if user is under penalty

2. **markAsPickedUp()**
   - Calls clearPenalty() on successful pickup
   - Resets user's penalty count to 0
