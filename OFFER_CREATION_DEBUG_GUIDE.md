# 🔍 DEEP DIVE - Why Can't Create Offers?

**Status:** Diagnostic scripts ready  
**Action:** Run these 2 SQL scripts in order

---

## 📋 Step 1: Run Diagnostics

### **File:** `DEEP_DIVE_OFFER_CREATION.sql`

This will check:
- ✅ Partner exists and status
- ✅ RLS policies on offers table
- ✅ Current auth user
- ✅ Offers table structure
- ✅ Simulate INSERT to test RLS
- ✅ Login status
- ✅ Final diagnosis

**Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:**

---

## 📋 Step 2: Test Manual Offer Creation

### **File:** `TEST_CREATE_OFFER_MANUALLY.sql`

This will:
- Create a test offer directly via SQL
- Bypass frontend entirely
- Prove if database/RLS is the problem or if it's frontend

**If this creates an offer successfully:** Problem is in frontend  
**If this fails:** Problem is RLS/partner status

## 🎯 What Console Logs Will Show

After hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+F5`), when you try to create an offer:

### Expected Console Output:
```javascript
Partner info: {
  id: "abc-123...",
  user_id: "xyz-789...",
  status: "APPROVED",  // ← MUST BE "APPROVED"
  business_name: "Your Business"
}

Current auth user: {
  id: "xyz-789...",  // ← MUST MATCH partner.user_id
  email: "your@email.com"
}

Creating offer with data: {
  partner_id: "abc-123...",
  title: "Test Offer",
  description: "...",
  category: "BAKERY",
  original_price: 10,
  smart_price: 5,
  quantity_available: 5,
  quantity_total: 5,
  pickup_start: "2025-11-09T...",
  pickup_end: "2025-11-09T...",
  status: "ACTIVE",
  expires_at: "2025-11-09T..."
}

// If success:
Offer created successfully: { id: "...", title: "Test Offer", ... }

// If failure:
Offer creation error details: {
  message: "new row violates row-level security policy",  // ← RLS BLOCKING
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  code: "42501"
}
```

## 🔎 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Partner Status Not APPROVED
**Console shows:** `status: "PENDING"`  
**Solution:** Run `COMPLETE_FIX_ALL.sql` (Part 1 approves partners)

### Issue 2: Auth User Mismatch
**Console shows:** `MISMATCH: Partner user_id does not match current user!`  
**Solution:** Log out and log back in, or database corruption

### Issue 3: RLS Policy Blocking
**Error code:** `42501`  
**Message:** `new row violates row-level security policy`  
**Solution:** Partner status not APPROVED or RLS policy misconfigured

### Issue 4: Missing Columns
**Error code:** `42703`  
**Message:** `column "xxx" does not exist`  
**Solution:** Already fixed in latest deploy (removed scheduled_publish_at, auto_expire_in)

### Issue 5: Data Type Mismatch
**Console shows:** Type errors or validation failures  
**Solution:** Check original_price, smart_price are numbers not strings

## 📊 Decision Tree

Run `DEEP_DIVE_OFFER_CREATION.sql` and check output:

### If "Partner not approved" appears:
→ Run `COMPLETE_FIX_ALL.sql` to approve partner

### If "No partner record" appears:
→ You need to create a partner account first

### If "Everything looks good":
→ Check browser console logs (F12)
→ Look for exact error message
→ Send me console screenshot

### If "Test insert worked":
→ Database is fine, problem is in frontend
→ Check if hard refresh was done
→ Verify deployed build version matches

## 🚀 Action Plan

1. **Run:** `COMPLETE_FIX_ALL.sql` (if not done)
   - Approves partners
   - Creates achievements

2. **Run:** `DEEP_DIVE_OFFER_CREATION.sql`
   - Read all output
   - Note any ❌ errors

3. **Run:** `TEST_CREATE_OFFER_MANUALLY.sql`
   - If creates offer → Frontend issue
   - If fails → Database/RLS issue

4. **Hard refresh browser:** `Ctrl+Shift+F5`

5. **Open console (F12)** and try to create offer

6. **Screenshot console output** and send to me

## 💡 Quick Checks

Before running SQL:

- [ ] Are you logged in as a partner?
- [ ] Did you run `COMPLETE_FIX_ALL.sql`?
- [ ] Did you hard refresh browser after deploy?
- [ ] Is Console (F12) open to see logs?

**The console logs + SQL diagnostic will show EXACTLY what's blocking offer creation!**
