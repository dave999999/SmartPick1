UPDATE user_stats SET
  total_reservations = total_reservations + 1,
  total_money_saved = total_money_saved + savings,
  category_counts = jsonb_set(...),
  partner_visit_counts = jsonb_set(...),
  unique_partners_visited = count(...)
WHERE user_id = customer_id;

-- Auto-check all 48 achievements
PERFORM check_user_achievements(customer_id);
```

### **Achievement Check:**
```sql
FOR each_achievement IN SELECT * FROM achievement_definitions:
  IF requirement_met AND not_already_unlocked:
    INSERT INTO user_achievements (user_id, achievement_id)
    PERFORM add_user_points(user_id, reward_points, 'achievement')
