# My Picks Page Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Data Fetching Issue
**Problem:** "My Picks" page does not display any reservations or pickup data.

**Solution:**
- Updated `MyPicks.tsx` to properly fetch reservations using `getCustomerReservations(user.id)`
- Added authentication check to ensure user is logged in before fetching data
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states
- Included related data from `offers` and `partners` tables through JOIN queries

### 2. Pickup Confirmation Not Working
**Problem:** Pickup button or confirmation flow is not working.

**Solution:**
- Implemented `handleConfirmPickup` function that calls `markAsPickedUp(reservation.id)`
- Added processing state to prevent duplicate submissions
- Automatically refreshes the reservations list after successful pickup
- Shows success toast notification
- Disables button while processing

### 3. Display Improvements
**Features Added:**
- Shows all reservation columns: Offer title, Store name, Quantity, Total Price, Pickup time, Status
- Status badges with color coding (Active=green, Picked Up=blue, Expired=gray, Cancelled=red)
- Formatted date/time display for pickup windows
- Formatted price display with currency symbol
- QR code view button for active reservations
- View details button for picked up reservations

### 4. Empty State
**Added friendly message when no reservations exist:**
- "You don't have any Smart Picks yet — go find your next one!"
- Includes a "Browse Offers" button to navigate back to home page
- Shows package icon for visual feedback

## Database Setup

### Required RLS Policies

Run the SQL script `fix-mypicks-rls.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to enable proper access:

```sql
-- Allow users to read their own reservations
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own reservations" ON reservations
  FOR SELECT
  USING (customer_id = auth.uid());

-- Allow users to update their own reservations
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own reservations" ON reservations
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (customer_id = auth.uid());
```

### Database Schema Requirements

Make sure your Supabase tables have these relationships:

**reservations table:**
- `id` (uuid, primary key)
- `customer_id` (uuid, references auth.users)
- `offer_id` (uuid, references offers)
- `partner_id` (uuid, references partners)
- `qr_code` (text)
- `quantity` (integer)
- `total_price` (numeric)
- `status` (text: 'ACTIVE', 'PICKED_UP', 'EXPIRED', 'CANCELLED')
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `expires_at` (timestamp)
- `picked_up_at` (timestamp, nullable)

**The API already includes proper JOIN queries to fetch:**
- Offer details (title, category, pickup times)
- Partner details (business_name, address)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Login as a Customer:**
   - Make sure you're logged in with a customer account
   - Navigate to `/my-picks` or click "My Picks" from the navigation

2. **View Reservations:**
   - Should see a table with all your reservations
   - Each row shows: offer title, store name, quantity, price, pickup time, status
   - Status badges should be color-coded

3. **Test Pickup Confirmation:**
   - Find an ACTIVE reservation
   - Click "Confirm Pickup" button
   - Should see success toast message
   - Status should update to "Picked Up"
   - Button should be replaced with "View Details"

4. **Test Empty State:**
   - If you have no reservations, should see:
     - Package icon
     - "No Smart Picks Yet" message
     - "Browse Offers" button

## Troubleshooting

### No reservations showing up?
1. Check if you're logged in (authentication required)
2. Verify RLS policies are created (run `fix-mypicks-rls.sql`)
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Verify reservations exist in Supabase for your user ID

### Pickup confirmation not working?
1. Check RLS policies allow UPDATE on reservations table
2. Verify the `markAsPickedUp` function in `api.ts` is working
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure reservation status is 'ACTIVE' before confirming

### Data not displaying correctly?
1. Verify JOIN queries are working (offers and partners tables)
2. Check that offer and partner data exists for the reservation
3. Ensure column names match the database schema

## API Functions Used

The following functions from `/workspace/shadcn-ui/src/lib/api.ts` are used:

- `getCurrentUser()` - Get authenticated user
- `getCustomerReservations(customerId)` - Fetch all reservations for a user
- `markAsPickedUp(reservationId)` - Update reservation status to PICKED_UP

All these functions already exist and are properly implemented with error handling.
