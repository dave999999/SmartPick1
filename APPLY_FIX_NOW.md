### ‚ö° FASTEST METHOD - Click and Run

1. **Click this link:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ggzhtpaxnhwcilomswtm/sql/new

2. **Copy this SQL** (Ctrl+C):
```sql
-- Drop the old constraint
ALTER TABLE partners DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS valid_partner_status;

-- Add the fixed constraint with APPROVED status
ALTER TABLE partners
ADD CONSTRAINT valid_partner_status
CHECK (status::text = ANY (ARRAY['PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'BLOCKED', 'PAUSED']::text[]));

-- Add documentation
COMMENT ON CONSTRAINT valid_partner_status ON partners

```

3. **Paste** the SQL into the SQL Editor (Ctrl+V)

4. **Click RUN** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

## Alternative Method - Use the Script

If you have your Supabase service role key:

```bash
node apply-migration.js YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

To get your service role key:
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ggzhtpaxnhwcilomswtm/settings/api
- Copy the **service_role** key (NOT the anon key)

---

## What This Fix Does

- **Before:** Database constraint only allowed: PENDING, BLOCKED, PAUSED ‚ùå
- **After:** Database constraint allows: PENDING, **APPROVED**, BLOCKED, PAUSED ‚úÖ

This is why your admin dashboard couldn't approve partners - the database was rejecting the APPROVED status!

---

## Verify It Worked

After applying the fix:
1. Go to your admin dashboard
2. Try to approve a partner
3. It should work without errors! ‚úÖ
