          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern the use of the SmartPick website and mobile experience ("Platform"). By accessing or using SmartPick, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Platform.

            SmartPick is operated by an individual entrepreneur registered in Georgia (IE Davit Batumashvili). SmartPick connects customers with partner merchants such as bakeries, cafes, restaurants and other local businesses ("Partners"). SmartPick is not a restaurant, bakery or delivery service; we are a reservation and discount-offer platform.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">3.1. SmartPoints are a virtual loyalty / utility unit used on the Platform to reserve Partner offers. SmartPoints:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>Have no cash value outside the Platform;</li>

            <li>Cannot be withdrawn as cash or transferred outside SmartPick.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">3.2. Users may obtain SmartPoints in several ways, for example:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>By purchasing SmartPoints through integrated payment providers (e.g. Unipay, Bank of Georgia or others in the future);</li>
            <li>Through promotional campaigns, bonuses or referral programs, as determined by SmartPick from time to time.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">3.3. Reservation and On-site Purchase:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>The user reserves a specific offer via SmartPick, often at a special or discounted price.</li>
            <li>The reservation is tied to a specific Partner location, pickup time window and conditions shown on the offer page.</li>
            <li>Unless stated otherwise, the <strong>final payment for the product itself is made directly at the Partner's physical location</strong>, at the reserved price.</li>
            <li>SmartPoints used for reservation may be consumed at the time of reservation and are generally non-refundable once the reservation is confirmed, except in cases where:
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>The Partner cancels the reservation;</li>
                <li>The Partner cannot provide the reserved product;</li>
                <li>SmartPick, at its own discretion, decides to issue a refund or adjustment.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">3.4. Payment Providers:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Card payments for SmartPoints or other services may be processed by third-party payment providers (e.g. Unipay) in compliance with their own terms and privacy policies.</li>
            <li>SmartPick does not store full card numbers or sensitive payment details on its own servers; such data is handled by the payment providers.</li>
