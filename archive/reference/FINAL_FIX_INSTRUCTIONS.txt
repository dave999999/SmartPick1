FINAL FIX FOR 403 ERROR - STEP BY STEP
========================================

YOU ARE STILL GETTING 403 ERROR BECAUSE THE SQL SCRIPT HASN'T BEEN RUN YET.

I CANNOT RUN IT FOR YOU - YOU MUST DO IT MANUALLY.

FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS:
========================================

STEP 1: Open this URL in a new browser tab
https://***REMOVED_PROJECT_ID***.supabase.co/project/***REMOVED_PROJECT_ID***/sql/new

STEP 2: Copy the SQL below (EVERYTHING between the lines)

----------------------------------------
ALTER TABLE public.offers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "partners_can_create_their_own_offers" ON public.offers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "partners_can_view_their_own_offers" ON public.offers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "anyone_can_view_public_offers" ON public.offers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "partners_can_update_their_own_offers" ON public.offers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "partners_can_delete_their_own_offers" ON public.offers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view active offers" ON public.offers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Partners can view own offers" ON public.offers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Partners can create offers" ON public.offers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Partners can update own offers" ON public.offers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Partners can delete own offers" ON public.offers;

CREATE POLICY "Partners can create offers" ON public.offers FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.partners WHERE partners.id = partner_id AND partners.user_id = auth.uid() AND partners.status = 'APPROVED'));

CREATE POLICY "Partners can view own offers" ON public.offers FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.partners WHERE partners.id = offers.partner_id AND partners.user_id = auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "Public can view active offers" ON public.offers FOR SELECT TO anon, authenticated
USING (status = 'ACTIVE' AND expires_at > NOW());

CREATE POLICY "Partners can update own offers" ON public.offers FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.partners WHERE partners.id = offers.partner_id AND partners.user_id = auth.uid()))
WITH CHECK (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.partners WHERE partners.id = partner_id AND partners.user_id = auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "Partners can delete own offers" ON public.offers FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.partners WHERE partners.id = offers.partner_id AND partners.user_id = auth.uid()));

SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'offers';
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'offers';
----------------------------------------

STEP 3: Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor

STEP 4: Click the green "RUN" button

STEP 5: Check the results at the bottom - you should see:
- offers table with rowsecurity = true
- 5 policies listed

STEP 6: Try creating an offer again - the 403 error should be GONE

========================================
WHY THIS IS NECESSARY:
========================================
The 403 error happens because:
1. Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on your offers table
2. But the policies that allow partners to insert data are MISSING
3. Without these policies, Supabase blocks ALL insert operations
4. The SQL script creates the missing policies

========================================
IMPORTANT NOTE:
========================================
Your partner account must have status = 'APPROVED' in the database.
If your partner status is 'PENDING', the policy will still block you.

To check your partner status, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT business_name, status FROM public.partners WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

If status is 'PENDING', change it to 'APPROVED':
UPDATE public.partners SET status = 'APPROVED' WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

========================================
